Thanks to the effort of Babber on re-doing the hierarchy and implementing various features, 
the code has been cleaned up nicely.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16OrGzy5h62ncpr-bDfyAYJZ_WfiDnuWdpV6BF1GZkgg/edit?usp=sharing
Here is a spreadsheet detailing weapon changes. It's also an edited copy of the vanilla spreadsheet, so credit to Knil on the TB forums for providing it.
Everything yellow should not be considered as it has not been validated. If anything looks weird, feel free to message me and I will check the code and spreadsheet to clear up any issue.
The spreadsheet will be updated further down the line, but as it is very tedious, manual work, it may take a while.
